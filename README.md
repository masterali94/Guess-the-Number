# Guess-the-Number
My first Python code for guessing a number


this code is kind of simple
first it introduces you with a simple greeting. 
then is asks the user to input a number. but uses a built in function to make sure its a number 
then it goes through a while loop since it is true. 
The has conditional statements comparing to the number the user entered to the computers auto selection. 
until the user guesses the right number the loop will continue because its ina while loop. 
then at the end when the number is guessed correctly the loop breaks off with a simple break statement.
